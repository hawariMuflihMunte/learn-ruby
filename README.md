My Ruby Journey

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and expressiveness. It was create by **_Yukihiro Matsumoto_** ("Matz") in the mid-1990's with the goal of combining the best features of other programming languages. Ruby is often described as having a clean and elegant syntax that prioritizes programmer happiness.

## Key Features

1. **Object-oriented**:\
Everything in Ruby is an object, including numbers, strings, and even classes. Ruby supports inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, allowing for the creation of reusable and modular code.
2. **Dynamic typing**:\
Ruby is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare variable types. The type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value it holds.
3. **Garbage collection**:\
Ruby has automatic memory management through a garbage collector, which handles the allocation and deallocation of memory, making memory management easier for developers.
4. **Blocks and closures**:\
Ruby provides a powerful feature called block, which are chunks of code that can be passed around as arguments to methods. Blocks allow for the creation of higher-order functions and enable elegant solutions for iterating over collections.
5. **Metaprogramming**:\
Ruby has robust support for metaprogramming, allowing you to modify the behavior of classes and objects at runtime. Metaprogramming enables dynamic code generation, DSL (Domain-Specific Language) creation, and more.
6. **Rich standard library**:\
Ruby comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of functionality, including I\O, network programming, regular expressions, JSON parsing, and more.
7. **RubyGems**:\
RubyGems is Ruby's package manager, which simplifies the installation and management of libraries (called gems). RubyGems has a vast ecosystem of gems that can be easily integrated into Ruby projects.
8. **Rails framework**:\
Ruby on Rails (often just called Rails) is a popular web application framework built on Ruby. Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and provides a set of conventions for rapid web application development.
