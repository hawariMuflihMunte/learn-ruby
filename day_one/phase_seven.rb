# Classes

Everything in Ruby is some kind of object.
Classes explain objects, how a certain object works.

For example:
You made a few Blurb objects and these objects are
explained in the Blurb class.

# Accessors

Accessors are variables attached to an object which
can be used 'outside' to the object.
(blurb2.time = Time.now)

# Object Variables

Object variables are the same variables you're
using for accessors, but 'inside' the object.
(@time = Time.now)
