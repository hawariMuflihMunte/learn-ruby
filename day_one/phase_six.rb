=begin

You're a level six Ruby cleric. I mean what a great
job you've done. Let's review:

# Data

You loaded some data off the internet, traversed a
data structure and selected values.

# Iterating

You iterated all elements of a hash you chainged
some more methods.

# Pretty Printing

And if that wasn't enough, you formatted and
printed some values in a way that is easy to read
for humans. In fact 'you made a real program'.

# IF-ELSIF-ELSE statement

=end
