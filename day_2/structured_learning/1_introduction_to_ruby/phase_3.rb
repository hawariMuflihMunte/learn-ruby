# Code comments in Ruby

=begin
Commenting code helps programmers write free text
that is commonly used to explain the code written,
or can even be used to add TODO's to the code.
There are two types of comments that can be
written in Ruby:

* Single line comment
# I am a single line comment

* Multi line comment
Just like this free text you are reading on.
